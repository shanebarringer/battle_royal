## battle royal
A Mortal Kombat influenced battle royal gem

### To Use
run `gem install battle_royal`

In your terminal simply run `$ battle`

Currently, the game allows for users to input a certain number of rounds. The battle will run until there is only 1 player standing.
I recommend that you run the game for at least 10 - 100 rounds
